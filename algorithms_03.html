		// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding
		// the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
		// 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, â€¦
		// By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed two 
		// million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. (hint: if (a % 2 == 0) { ... })

		arr = [1, 2]

		for (var i = 1; arr[i] < 2000000; i ++) {
			if ((arr[i] + arr[i-1]) < 2000000) {
				arr.push(arr[i] + arr[i-1]);	
			}
		}

		console.log(arr);
		// even though it wouldn't change the answer (since the next number is odd), I made sure 
		// my array did not include any values over 2000000!

		var num = 0;

		for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i ++) {
			if (arr[i] % 2 === 0) {
				num = num + arr[i];
			}
		}

		console.log(num);  // Answer is 1089154
